There are some times we might want to skip a specific iteration of a loop instead of breaking out of it. Imagine we only want to do things for odd numbers.

We want to be able to say if <define>`i`</define> is odd, don't run the loop this time.

But we don't want to fully exit from the loop. We just want to skip this single iteration and then look at the next one.

And for this, we have another keyword called `continue`.

When Jiki sees `continue`, he just jumps back to the top of the loop for the next iteration. So in a for-of loop, if he sees `continue`, he moves on to the next item in the list.

```javascript
for (let item of list) {
  if (item === "something") {
    continue; // Skips rest of loop for "something"
  }
  // Rest of the loop...
}
```

In a for loop, he hits the increment of the `i++` and then starts the next iteration.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skips rest of loop for even numbers
  }
  // Rest of the loop...
}
```

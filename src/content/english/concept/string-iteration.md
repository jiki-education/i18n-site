You can access a single letter of a string using square brackets. Now we're going to look at how to loop through a string, getting out each letter one at a time.

And to do that, we need a new type of loop. So far, we've used the repeat loop, and now we're going to use something called a <define info="loops over each element of a collection in turn; keep the English keywords for/of, gloss the meaning">`for of`</define> loop. That's two new keywords, `for` and `of`.

The `for` keyword is one that we'll see in quite a few places as we move forward. It can be by itself, or it can be paired with `in` or `of`. For now, we're going to focus on that last one, `of`.

So let's take a look at some code.

We'll start off by creating a variable called <define>`name`</define> containing the string <define info="say 'the name Jeremy', or use name signifiers such as -san if appropriate in the language">`"Jeremy"`</define>. Nothing new here.

Then we have the loop line, and there's a lot going on there, so let's talk through it slowly.

```javascript
let name = "Jeremy"
for (let letter of name) {
  // ...
}
```

Firstly, we have the `for` keyword. That tells Jiki that we want to do some looping. So he looks ahead and sees `of` and knows that we want to do some "for of" looping.

And that means that rather than using a repeat loop where we say, "Let's loop through 10 times," we're saying, "Let's loop through all of the letters in the string." That's what "for of" means.

Then we have this <define>`let letter`</define> bit. This is exactly the same as what we have above it with `let name`. We're just creating a variable called `letter`.

The difference is that rather than being explicit about what goes in it, we're telling Jiki to put each letter in the string into it one at a time.

So Jiki sees `for`, checks for `of`, then gets going. He looks at the first letter in the string, `"J"` in this case, and puts it in a new box called `letter`. We could call that anything, by the way. It doesn't have to be `letter`. We've just decided to call it `letter` here.

Then he runs the code inside the curly braces, and you can do anything here you'd do anywhere else in code. The only difference is that this block of code is gonna run once for each letter in the string, and it will have this variable available.

Every time Jiki gets to the closing curly bracket, Jiki throws away the `letter` box and creates a new one with the next letter in it. So the first time, he'll throw away the `"J"` and put an `"e"` in the box instead. Then he'll do the same for `"r"`, then `"e"`, then `"m"`, then `"y"`. Six letters, six times around the loop. It takes a little bit of time to get used to the syntax, but it's not really that hard of a concept.

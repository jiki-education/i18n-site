You run a small hairdressing salon that focusses on speed over quality. People might leave a little rough around the edges, but they're not having to spend too long in the chair.

You offer a few different services from styling to full haircuts, which take different times to complete. You run the salon on a first-come, first-serve basis. There's no appointment system.

As it gets towards the end of the day, you need a way of knowing if you have time for any new people that come into the shop.

Write a function called <define>`canFitIn`</define> which takes three inputs:

- The first is the haircuts that you have in the queue already (list of strings)
- The second is the haircut that the new person wants (string)
- The third is the amount of minutes left in the day (number)

Return a boolean for whether you can fit the person in.

The styles you offer are:

- Mohawk: 20 minutes
- Slicked-Back Pixie: 15 minutes
- Bob: 25 minutes
- Shave and Polish: 15 minutes
- Afro Trim: 45 minutes
- Up-do: 30 minutes

Raindrops is a version of the classic FizzBuzz challenge that's been used in programming interviews forever.

Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.

We do this by seeing what the number is divisible by (e.g. the number 10 is divisible by 1, 2, 5 and 10. The number 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12).

If a given number:

- is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
- is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
- is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
- is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.

You need to create a function called <define>`raindrops(num)`</define> that takes the number as an input and returns its Raindrops sounds.

Build the result string using <define>concatenation</define> (`+`) or a <define>template string</define>.

### Examples

- `raindrops(28)` returns "Plong" because 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5.
- `raindrops(30)` returns "PlingPlang" because 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7.
- `raindrops(34)` returns "34" because 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

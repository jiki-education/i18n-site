Welcome to your first drawing exercise. In this exercise you'll be drawing rectangles using the <define>`rectangle`</define> <define>function</define>.

To draw rectangles we need to know the top and left positions, and the width and height of the rectangle. When we use the `rectangle` function, we can specify these as <define>inputs</define>:

- <define>`left`</define>: The left side of the rectangle
- <define>`top`</define>: The top of the rectangle
- <define>`width`</define>: How wide the rectangle is
- <define>`height`</define>: How high the rectangle is

<img src="/static/images/exercise-assets/fix-wall/intro-rectangle.webp" alt="Fix Wall" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin-bottom: 8px;" />

You're always drawing on a canvas that's 100 width and 100 high. So the top-left of the canvas is `0,0` and the bottom right is `100,100`.

### Fixing the wall

Your job is to use three rectangles to fill the holes in the wall.

### Working out the correct coordinates

You can **hover over the drawing space** to find co-ordinates.

To make your life easier, **all the numbers used are divisible by 10** (e.g. `10`, `20`, `30`, etc are valid but `5`, `12`, `25`, etc are not).

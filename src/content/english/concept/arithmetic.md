So far when we've created variables, we've just used simple values; a number like `50` or a string like `"yellow"`. Where variables become much more powerful is when we can use them in combination with each other. So where we can say the left edge of the rectangle should be a certain distance from the edge of the canvas.

In programming, we can use normal, basic maths, things like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, and we can use the variables that we've already set as part of that.

Let's start by saying we want to draw a rectangle on our canvas, and we want it to start 10 in from the left and from the right, and 20 in from the top and the bottom. So it's going to be in the middle of the canvas, slightly longer than it is tall.

<img
  class="concept-image"
  src="/static/images/concept-assets/arithmetic/rectangle-on-canvas.webp"
  alt="A blue rectangle centred on the canvas, 10 in from the left and right and 20 in from the top and bottom"
  width="399"
  height="400"
/>

When we draw a rectangle, we need to know its <define>`left`</define>, <define>`top`</define>, <define>`width`</define>, and <define>`height`</define>, as well as its color. So we can start off by writing that out.

And now we need to actually work out what its `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height` should be. So let's set them. `Left` is 10. `Top` is 20. The `width`, well, the `width` is the size of the canvas, which is 100, minus the 10 on the left and the 10 on the right, so that's 80. And the `height` is the height of the canvas, which is also 100, minus the 20 at the top and the 20 at the bottom, so 60.

```javascript
let left = 10
let top = 20
let width = 80
let height = 60

rectangle(left, top, width, height, "blue")
```

So we can set those variables. `Left`, 10, `top`, 20, `width`, 80, `height`, 60. But what happens now if we want to move the rectangle in a bit, make it a bit smaller? If we want to move it 20 from the left and the right and 30 from the top and the bottom? We have to go and work everything out again. The `width` is now 100 minus 20 minus 20, and the `height` is 100 minus 30 minus 30, and this is definitely more work and more maths than I want to do. So instead, we can tell the computer to do it for us.

We can set the `width` to be 100 minus the `left` minus the `left`, and the `height` to be 100 minus the `top` minus the `top`, because it's the same top and bottom. Or we could write that out as 100 minus the `left` times two, or 100 minus the `top` times two.

```javascript
let width = 100 - left * 2
let height = 100 - top * 2
```

And now if we change the `left` or the `top`, the `width` and the `height` will also change. So things are starting to relate to each other. And what about the canvas? That's 100 now. But what if our canvas changes to be 200 wide and high instead? Well, we should probably set a variable called <define>`canvasSize`</define> and set that to be 100. And now our `width` is `canvasSize` minus `left` times two, and our `height` is `canvasSize` minus `top` times two.

```javascript
let canvasSize = 100
let left = 20
let top = 30
let width = canvasSize - left * 2 // 60
let height = canvasSize - top * 2 // 40

rectangle(left, top, width, height, "blue")
```

Let's think about what Jiki is doing when we write let `height` equals `canvasSize` minus `top` times two. Well, he starts by getting the `top` box off the shelf, and he finds 30 in it, and he gets out his pocket calculator and does 30 times two, and he makes a mental note of 60.

<img
  class="concept-image"
  src="/static/images/concept-assets/arithmetic/flow-of-images-1.webp"
  alt="Jiki taking the top box off the shelf and working out 30 times two is 60"
  width="377"
  height="400"
/>

And then he gets the `canvasSize` box off the shelf, finds 100 in it, and he works out that 100 minus 60 is 40. And now he knows really what we're saying is let `height` equal 40. So he obeys the let, getting a new box and writing `height` on it, and then he puts 40 inside it. And then when he uses `height` later, he just gets the 40 back out again.

<img
  class="concept-image"
  src="/static/images/concept-assets/arithmetic/flow-of-images-3.webp"
  alt="Jiki getting a new box, writing height on it, and putting 40 inside"
  width="462"
  height="400"
/>

Once you have everything working in an exercise, play with changing the values of the variables and see what happens. Watch how they grow and how they shrink. Take your time, think about the relationships between things.

The functions you've made so far always do exactly the same thing every time. <define>`turnAround`</define> always turns left twice. <define>`shootIfAlienAbove`</define> always checks and shoots.

But think about the functions you've been using throughout the course, how they do different things depending on the inputs. Rectangle takes a left, a top, a width, a height as inputs, and then draws a different rectangle based on what you tell it.

Now we'll add input slots to your own functions too.

You need to know two things to do this. The first is how this actually looks, what you need to write, and the second is what's actually happening.

The first bit is quite straightforward. You just add some normal brackets and then the names of any inputs you want.

So imagine we're creating a function that should shoot many times. Let's call it <define>`shootMany`</define>.

We'd write it like this:

```javascript
function shootMany(numShots) {
  // ...
}
```

When you want to use this function, you'd call it with the number of shots you want:

```javascript
shootMany(5)
shootMany(2)
```

Now, this is the key bit. When the code runs, whatever you put into that input, `5` or `2`, mini-Jiki, with the hat inside the function, takes that input and puts it into a box called <define>`numShots`</define>, and then puts that box on the shelves inside the function for you to use in the function's code.

I'll say that again.

When we write `shootMany(5)` to use the function, Jiki on the outside goes and gets a `5` and puts it into the input slot of `shootMany`. Inside the machine, mini-Jiki takes that `5` out and puts it in a box called `numShots`, because that's the name that you gave to that input slot, and then he puts that box on the shelves inside the function inside the machine.

  alt="Mini-Jiki placing the numShots box onto the shelves inside the shootMany machine"
  width="500"
  height="302"
/>

And then within the function, you can just use the `numShots` box just like you'd use any other box. There's nothing magical about the name `numShots`. We could have called it anything we wanted. All it is is an instruction for mini-Jiki to always create a box with that label on inside the function and put whatever's passed into that slot into that box.

And once you've got a value in that box, you can do anything you'd normally do with boxes. You could use the `numShots` box as part of a repeat loop to shoot the correct amount of times. And you can have more than one input too. Just separate them with commas. So if we have a function called <define>`drawStar`</define> that draws a star based on its top-left position, you'd write it like this:

```javascript
function drawStar(left, top) {
  // ...
}
```

  alt="The drawStar machine with two input slots, taking two separate values"
  width="453"
  height="400"
/>

And then when the function is called, mini-Jiki is just gonna store the values that are passed into the inputs in boxes named <define>`left`</define> and <define>`top`</define>, and then store those on the shelves inside the functions.

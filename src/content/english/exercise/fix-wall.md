Welcome to your first drawing exercise. In this exercise you'll be drawing rectangles using the <define>`rectangle`</define> <define>function</define>.

To draw rectangles we need to know the top and left positions, and the width and height of the rectangle. When we use the `rectangle` function, we can specify these as <define>inputs</define>:

- <define>`left`</define>: The left side of the rectangle
- <define>`top`</define>: The top of the rectangle
- <define>`width`</define>: How wide the rectangle is
- <define>`height`</define>: How high the rectangle is

<img src="/static/images/exercise-assets/fix-wall/intro-rectangle.webp" alt="Fix Wall" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin-bottom: 8px;" />

You're always drawing on a canvas that's 100 width and 100 high. So the top-left of the canvas is `0,0` and the bottom right is `100,100`. **You can hover over the canvas** to check where something needs to go.

### Fixing the wall

Your job is to use three rectangles to fill the holes in the wall.

To make your life easier, the top, left, height and widths are all divisible by 10.

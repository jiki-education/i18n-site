In this exercise we draw ellipses for the first time, and also think a bit more about the symmetry we mentioned in Foxy Face.

This exercise uses ellipses. Ellipses are like stretched out circles. We still specify the center point, but rather than just one radius we use two - the horizontal radius and the vertical radius. If the vertical radius is larger than the horizontal one, the ellipse will look tall. And if the horizontal radius is larger than the vertical one, the ellipse will look squat. If you set both the radii to be the same, you have a circle again!

The <define>`ellipse`</define> function takes 5 inputs: the center position (<define>`centerX`</define>, <define>`centerY`</define>), the horizontal radius (<define>`radiusX`</define>), the vertical radius (<define>`radiusY`</define>), and the color:

### The Penguin

We've drawn half the image for you. Your task is to draw the right hand side of the penguin. The finished drawing should look like this:

<img src="/static/images/exercise-assets/penguin/penguin-finished.webp" alt="Penguin" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin-bottom: 8px;" />

### Working out the correct coordinates

Unlike previous exercises, the aim is to solve this **WITHOUT** hovering over the coordinates or guessing at them.

By reading the code that's there, you should be able to work out the other details to make it symmetrical. Remember, the top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. The penguin is sitting in the middle.

For the nose, you should **change** the middle coordinates of the triangle. Don't add a new triangle.

**Start by pressing _"Run Code"_** to see what the starting image looks like. Have fun!

Last time you saw the wall, you added a top layer to finish it off. In this exercise, you build on that by making a whole wall from scratch, 55 bricks in total.

The final wall should look like this:

<img src="/static/images/exercise-assets/build-wall/completed-wall.webp" alt="Completed Wall" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin-bottom: 8px;" />

Things you need to know:

- **Every** brick is 10 high and 20 wide.
- Bricks can start or end **outside** the canvas if needed, but must not be **fully** outside the canvas.
- The rows alternate between starting at the left edge (5 bricks), and starting off-screen to the left (6 bricks). (Bottom row is 5, top row is 6)
- The <define>`rectangle`</define> function can only appear once in your code!

The aim of this exercise is for you to experiment with using `repeat` blocks and conditionals together. There are many different ways to solve this exercise. Your challenge is to solve it in a way that results in clean, satisfying code.

A good question to ask yourself is "How would a bricklayer go about doing this in the real world?"

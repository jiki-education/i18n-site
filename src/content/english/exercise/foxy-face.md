This exercise introduces you to the <define>`triangle`</define> function. You use it with 7 inputs. The first 6 inputs are pairs of coordinates for the three corners. The final input is the `color`:

- <define>`x1`</define>, <define>`y1`</define>: The first corner point
- <define>`x2`</define>, <define>`y2`</define>: The second corner point
- <define>`x3`</define>, <define>`y3`</define>: The third corner point
- <define>`color`</define>: The color of the triangle (e.g. `"orange"`)

### Drawing a fox face

Your job is to use triangles to build a geometric fox face:

<img src="/static/images/exercise-assets/foxy-face/example.svg" alt="Foxy Face" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin-bottom: 8px;" />

The face is horizontally symmetrical (the left side is identical to the right side). And it has 8 triangles in total:

- Two `"white"` cheeks
- Two `"brown"` ears
- Two `"orange"` face halves
- A `"charcoal"` nose (two triangles)

(Make sure to use those colors when drawing the triangles, and remember to check you write them as <define>strings</define>!)

We've drawn outlines of some of the parts for you to help you get started. If you follow the order given in the comments you'll find it makes life a little easier.

Also, to make your life even easier, all the numbers used are divisible by 5 (e.g. `5`, `10`, `15`, etc are valid but `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `11`, etc are not). You'll see this pattern a lot in the following exercises.

One final thing. You can hover over the space to find co-ordinates. That's great for the left side, but as the right side is symmetrical - can you solve that without needing to hover?

Good luck!

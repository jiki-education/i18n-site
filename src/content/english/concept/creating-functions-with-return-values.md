You now know how to create functions with and without inputs. There's one final thing to learn, and then you're gonna be a function-making expert, and that thing is how to give your functions a return chute.

You've already used lots of functions that return things. <define>`isAlienAbove`</define> gives you back true or false. <define info="Math means maths; randomInt means random integer">`Math.randomInt(1, 10)`</define> gives you back a random number.

When Jiki uses those functions, something is popping out of the output chute, which he can then go and use.

<img

  src="/static/images/concept-assets/creating-functions-with-return-values/output-chute.webp"
  alt="Jiki collecting a value as it pops out of a machine's output chute"
  width="500"

/>

So to do this, we need another new keyword, and that is the `return` keyword.

The `return` keyword tells Mini Jiki to push something out of the return chute.

<img
  class="concept-image"
  src="/static/images/concept-assets/creating-functions-with-return-values/return-keyword-push.webp"
  alt="Mini Jiki inside the machine pushing a 42 value out through the output chute"
  width="500"
  height="335"
/>

So let's make a function, and let's call it <define>`meaningOfLife`</define>, and this function's job is always just to return the number `42`. It doesn't have any inputs. We write it like this:

```javascript
function meaningOfLife() {
  return 42
}
```

<img
  class="concept-image"
  src="/static/images/concept-assets/creating-functions-with-return-values/meaning-of-life-42.webp"
  alt="The meaningOfLife machine sending the number 42 out of its output chute"
  width="500"
  height="323"
/>

Now anywhere we use `meaningOfLife()` in our code, we get the number `42` back to use just like any other value. We can put it in a box with `let`, we can pass it as an input to another function, we can compare it in an if statement.

Functions with returns can also take inputs. You might write an <define>`ageBracket(age)`</define> function that returns `"Sorry, too young"` when `age` is under 18, and `"Welcome"` otherwise. Whoever calls it gets back whichever string the function returned.

```javascript
function ageBracket(age) {
  if (age >= 18) {
    return "Welcome"
  }
  return "Sorry, too young"
}
```

  alt="An age value being dropped into the machine's input slot so it can decide what to return"

/>

This is how programming works at its core. We create lots of these little building blocks and then piece them together into programs.

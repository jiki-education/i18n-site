Welcome to Wordle, the game that went viral during Covid-19 lockdowns!

The game works like this:

- There is a secret word the user is trying to guess.
- The user has 6 guesses to get it right.
- For each guess there are 5 boxes, one for each letter:
  - If a letter is correct, the box goes green.
  - If a letter is in the secret word but in the wrong place, the box goes yellow.
  - If a letter is not in the secret word, the box goes gray.

In a few exercises, you'll implement the whole Wordle game, but for **this exercise**, you're just going to get things working for the first row.

To do that, you need to create a function called <define>`processGuess(target, guess)`</define>. The words you receive into your function will always be lowercase.

The function should work out the state of each letter in the guess, then call the <define>`colorRow(1, states)`</define> function with an array of states for each letter: either `"correct"`, `"present"`, or `"absent"`.

For example, `processGuess("hello", "holes")` should use `colorRow` with:

```javascript
colorRow(1, ["correct", "present", "correct", "present", "absent"])
```

Check you understand that before continuing!

Also, if you're a Wordle aficionado, then you might notice the rules above are **slightly simplified** compared to the official game. In this exercise, please stick to these simplified rules and we'll introduce the full set in the next Wordle exercise!

### Methods

As in the last couple of exercises, you can build up the array of states using the `push` method, which adds an element onto the end of an array. For example, `states.push("correct")` adds `"correct"` to the end of the `states` array.

You also have the `includes` method if you want to check if one string contains another string.

Good luck!
